Fleet Academy:

So what will Fleet Academy be?

Fleet Academy currently is a HTML game made with phaser. While the game is not in a full running state,
development is always active! Fleet Academy will offer turn based fleet combat, and is heavily influenced by starship troopers,
Pokemon, and other JRPG elements. 

Key Features:


Single Player:
	
	1) Main Objectives: The main objective of this project, is to use JavaScript, HTML, and Phaser.js to create a cohesive game. My hopes is to one day 
	publish this game on the web for free.

	2) Influences: I just want to say outloud that the influences of this game are as follows: 
	Asthetics: Starship Troopers
	Gameplay: Pokemon
	Story: Original and clumsy.

	3) Main Story: The main story will be a small single player experience. Currently, there are 5 levels planned and all of this is hinged on the fact that
	I will be able to store all this data in an HTML game. The player will take control of a young student, enrolled in the `Imperium Galacticum` Fleet Academy.
	This is your first day of fleet academy, and you will compete with other students to earn the title of 'Lord Among Admirals'. Students will engage in simulated 
	stellar combat between contigents of other student's fleets. Much like a pokemon trainer fights other trainers to be the victor of the Elite four. 
		-> World Historical Setting TBA.

	4) Save/Load game files: I read this is a possible feature in Phaser.js built games. However, I personally have no experience in this. Production in this feature
	may come last depending on my abillity to understand the depth of what is needed to save a game!



This will be updated as features are added and ideas become more specific. In the meantime, Fly Safe out there Cadets! o7!
